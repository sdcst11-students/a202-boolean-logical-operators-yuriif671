### Assignment #004b Logical Operators (Total Marks 14)

Objectives:
* Evaluate Boolean Logic Statements

Sometimes you may need to check multiple conditions.  One option is to nest if statements
within if statements, but you can also check conditional statements using the operators 

Open up the file called example1.py to see how "and" operators work.
Open up the file called example2.py to see how "or" operators work.
Open up the file called example3.py to see how brackets and order of operations work
